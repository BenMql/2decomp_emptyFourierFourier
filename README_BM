                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ./src/fft_fftw_f03.f90 file has been modified to add the IN_CORE_CHEBYSHEV flag on top of PHYSICAL_IN_X and PHYSICAL_IN_Z. IN_CORE_CHEBYSHEV is similar to PHYSICAL_IN_Z, except that the transform along the contiguous dimension is skipped. 

Hence, in-core DCT can be computed (serially) by external routines, before calling 2decomp_fft complex to real transforms. This paves the way for DCT-DFT-DFT transforms, and resolution of PDEs in the plane layer geometry.

Modifications are minor and installation is similar to the original library. 
The only difference is that the library *has to* be linked against fftw3_f03. 
(The reason is that only this interface has been patched.)
